## Project Overview:
This project involves extracting, profiling, and analyzing FIFA World Cup data from the Wikipedia website. The primary focus is on creating a comprehensive report that includes key information such as the year, host country, champion, runner-up, final score, and the number of participating teams. The project aims to provide insightful visualizations for better understanding and interpretation of the data.

## Project Steps:
### 1. Data Extraction:

Extract data from the relevant tables on the Wikipedia page: [FIFA World Cup Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup) using Power BI import mode.

### 3. Report Visualization:
I chose appropriate visuals to convey the following insights:</br>
a. Host Country Frequency: </br>
&emsp;Display the number of times the championship was hosted by the host country  on a map. </br>
b. Top 5 World Cup Winners:</br>
&emsp;Highlight the top 5 countries that have won the World Cup the most.</br>
c. Teams Participation:</br>
&emsp;Showcase the number of teams that participated in each championship.</br>
d. Detailed Table:</br>
&emsp;Create a table displaying all the relevant fields in a clear and organized manner.</br>
e. Yearly Filtering:</br>
&emsp;Implement a filter mechanism allowing users to filter the dashboard by year.</br>
